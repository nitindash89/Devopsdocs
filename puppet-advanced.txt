add user srikanth (linux specific command )
the above is os specific , this is a blocker 

cannot execute for other os 

rather i can use following by puppet

user 
{
  name => 'srikanth',
  group => 'srikanth',

}

puppet resource --types | more


modules come from init.pp 

it applies resources in which they are declared  

explicit relations 

1) notify => (meta parameter)

   notify the next execution , for example 

if   os family debian 

notify => exec (install ) ( when we wanted to notify the subsequent task to take over the control from this point)


  exec ( install => tomcat.exe)

the above means if it is a debian os it comes inside if loop

and if it is successful notify the subsequent task to take over


2) chained arrow ->

3) requires ( ex tomcat requires java)



package { 'openssh-server': -1
ensure ==>present,-2
before => file ['/etc/ssh/sshd_Config'],
}

File { '/etc/ssh/sshd_Config':
ensure => file,
mode => '0600'
source =>
'puppet://modules/sshd/sshd_config',
require => Package ['openssh-server'],
}
the above says for modifying sshd_Config 
file u need openssh-server ( thats why we have require =>)

similarly 

File {' /etc/ssh/sshd_config':
ensure => file,
mode => '0600',
source =>
'puppet://modules/sshd/sshd_config',
notify => service ['sshd],

service {'sshd':
ensure => running,
enable =>true
subscribe =>
File ['etc/ssh/sshd_config']
}

the above command says once we modify file 

notify the service sshd to restart ( irrespective if it is 

started or stopped )

lly , subscribe means any modification on sshd_config 

we will need to restart , subscription :) 

"notify" means if I change that should also change 

"subscribe" means if that changes , I should also change 


we can give multiple tasks for these 

for example 

  require => [ Exec['extracttomcat'], User['tomcat'] ] ,


the above require says , tomcat should be extracted and 

the user tomcat should be present 

types of chaining (Arrows , -> and ~>)

class {'java'} -> class {'tomcat'}

the above says for left resource is done first before 

the right resource ( like dependency)


where as class {'java'} ~> {'tomcat'}

this means , if java version changes change tomcat as well

because logically ,java 7 work well with tomcat 7 

java 8 requires latest tomcat 

combinations example 

java 8 ->tomcat 7

java8 will install 

tomcat remains same 

java 8 ~> tomcat 7

java 8 will install 

tomcat7 will restart 

java 8 ~> tomcat 8

will skip java 8 (since 

we already installed previous step)

tomcat 8 will be installed 

and start the tomcat 8 service)

a->b (also called as refresh)

class wordpress

require => apache 

require => mysql

variables

$_=10  integer
$__='A',  character
$name='Sri'  string 

arrays

hash

scope

facts 

facts are system level variables

so facter runs in background

type facter to get the same 



ex : hostname 


you cannot assign same

variable different values  

different types of data types

service { 'sshd'

ensure => running,
}

 generating module

puppet module generate srikanth

puppet module list 

we can change 

vi metadata.json 

pupet module search java

puppet module search puppetlabs-java

puppet module search puppetlabs-mysql

puppet module install puppetlabs-mysql 

the above is when you find a perfect match

puppet module upgrade puppetlabs-mysql

puppet module uninstall puppetlabs-mysql

puppet module list (from modules home direc)

pls see the direc structure , give all details 

we can change version in metadata.json

by default puppet applies all the changes from

site.pp files to all the nodes 

i can target by giving 

node '1' , '2', '3'
